Database of Barrier Island Morphology

NeticaProfile1.xlsx is a the database developed by Sheppard Medlin for a curated set of Barrier Islands along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the United States.  Details can be found in Medlin et al. (2022).  Data from this database came from the following sources:

CoastMorph_Dbase_v37.mat is a database developed by Dr. Julia Mulhern for a much wider variety of islands but with fewer parameters for each island.
